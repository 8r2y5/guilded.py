Bot commands framework - ``ext.commands``
==========================================

Similarly to the rest of the library, you'll find that ``guilded.ext.commands``
is identical within applicable API constraints to ``discord.ext.commands``.
`Discord.py's documentation <https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html>`_
offers a concise explanation of its commands extension, which also applies here:

    [the library] offers a lower level aspect on interacting with Discord.
    Often times, the library is used for the creation of bots. However this
    task can be daunting and confusing to get correctly the first time. Many
    times there comes a repetition in creating a bot command framework that
    is extensible, flexible, and powerful. For this reason, [the library]
    comes with an extension library that handles this for you.
